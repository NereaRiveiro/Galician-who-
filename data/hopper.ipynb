A cashier attentively tends to business at her register. Though they appear weary and detached, these two women hold posts newly available to female city dwellers outside the home. The painting’s title alludes to a recent social innovation in which establishments advertised \"tables for ladies\" in order to welcome their newly mobile female customers, who, if seen dining alone in public previously, were assumed to be prostitutes.',\n",
       " 'From Williamsburg Bridge': 'In this painting, Hopper depicts the austere facades of four apartment buildings and reduces the steel suspension of the Williamsburg Bridge to the margins. Completed in 1903 and connecting Brooklyn with Manhattan, the structure is indicated only by the unobtrusive railing rising at a slight diagonal along the bottom of the canvas. As opposed to focusing on the bridge that facilitates movement in and out of the city, Hopper creates an image absent of noise or motion. He emphasizes the alienation and anonymity of urban life by including a single figure: a woman sitting alone in a top story window.',\n",

       " 'Coast Guard Station, Two Lights, Maine': 'On his repeated summer visits to Cape Elizabeth, Maine, Hopper painted several views of the Two Lights lighthouses and a Coast Guard station that stood in an adjacent cove (see MMA 62.95). In Hopper\\'s ledger, this location, with its white sand and vivid blue water, is described as having a \"very clean & swept look\" (Artist\\'s ledger, Whitney Museum of American Art). His composition of the Coast Guard station and its landscape is similarly and appropriately clean. The water and the rocks in the foreground are painted in loose, limpid washes of color, and the repeated angles of the station\\'s various gables, punctuated by the slender vertical of the flagpole that rises from its roof, are more tightly delineated. This is a sunny, tranquil landscape whose subject nonetheless alludes to the darker possibilities of dangerous rescues from the ocean. Hopper had worked very little in watercolor before 1923. However, he soon demonstrated a mastery of the medium after his wife Jo, who was also an artist, encouraged him to utilize it for his outdoor studies.',\n",

       " 'Saltillo Mansion': \"Hopper and his wife Jo traveled to Mexico in the summer of 1943, seeking a change of scene and new subjects for Hopper's art. After stopping in Mexico City, they traveled 500 miles north to Saltillo, a smaller city whose cool, dry climate and views of nearby mountains made it a popular destination for vacationers. The Hoppers stayed at a hotel called the Guarhado House on Victoria Street, and Hopper painted several watercolors from the hotel roof. From this height, he could see the mountains over the buildings of the city, but his depictions of the scene still suggest the urban development that was blocking his enjoyment of the natural setting. In another work, he showed the colorful towers of Saltillo's eighteenth-century cathedral, a reminder of the city's roots as a Spanish settlement; here, however, he limits his scope to a partial view of some domestic architecture. The houses' simple, blocklike forms, trimmed with lattices and decorative carving, are a dazzling white against the sky and the distant hills. Hopper had initially complained that Saltillo was noisy and congested, but from his rooftop he could project onto this new setting the same stillness and solitude that pervaded his scenes of New York and New England.\",\n",

Set on a rocky promontory in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, the architecture is bathed in bright sunlight offset by dark shadows. Standing proudly upright and seen from below, the lighthouse at Two Lights seems to symbolize a resolute resistance, even refusal, to submit to change or nature. For Hopper, who had been summering in Maine since 1914, the lighthouse also signified a pleasurable reprieve from life in New York.',\n",
       " 'Office in a Small City': 'The Metropolitan Museum acquired this painting shortly after it was completed in late October 1953. Begun in Cape Cod over the summer and finished in New York City, it was the only oil painting Hopper produced that year. Reprising one of his signature subjects—a solitary figure, physically and emotionally detached from his surroundings and other people—it was described by the artist’s wife as \"the man in concrete wall.\"',\n",

The artist had returned to New York from Paris in 1910 and took up etching when his paintings failed to find buyers, producing about 70 prints between 1915 and 1923. In addition to depicting men and women experiencing the urban fabric of New York, he evoked memories of France, and explored rural and coastal landscapes in Maine and Massachusetts. After Hopper received two awards for his prints in 1923—the Logan Prize from the Chicago Society of Etchers and the W. A.
